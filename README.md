Project Overview
 Ad Mini App is a decentralised advertising tool built on the Base blockchain that lets advertisers and content creators meet in a way that is open, quick, and doesn't require trust.  By using blockchain technology, our platform gets rid of middlemen, lowers fees, and makes sure that everyone in the advertising environment gets paid fairly.
 Important Things

 Decentralized Ad Marketplace: Direct link between marketers and content creators
 Transparent Payments: All deals are recorded on-chain and viewable to all parties
 Agreements Based on Smart Contracts:  Advertising plans that are carried out automatically
 Simple to use  How to use:  Simple and simple web tool for organising campaigns
 Stablecoin Integration: For stable prices, it uses an ERC20 stablecoin.

 Smart Contracts and Technical Architecture
 There are two main smart contracts on our website.

First, run the development server:

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
